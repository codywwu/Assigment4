How to run our program: java -jar Assignment4.jar

The data.xml file should be placed in the res file.

At the beginning of the program, you will be asked to enter your username. If you are a first-time user, we will record an XML file that holds your username and upcoming values, or if you are an experienced user( user on file), the program will load your XML generated since your first login in the background. 

After you log in,  you will see our welcome menu, then enter “2”(Create new portfolio) and hit return. Here, you will be asked to create your portfolio in 2 ways: creating by filling out our form or you can import your XML file, and I will fully explain how to create them by each.

Firstly, in your terminal, enter “2” again(Fill out the form), then hit enter. This is where you would want to create a portfolio by our prompt questions, and then the program will ask you to name the portfolio; you can enter whatever you want, but with one constrain: you cannot enter a portfolio name that is already on file, just like for username input. Then, you will be asked to enter the stock symbol you want to purchase from, unlike the previous prompt; this time, we will bring your stock symbol to API check to see if your stock symbol would represent a company. If the symbol passes the checking, the program will ask you for the shares you want to purchase. Since we are not playing with any money yet at this point of the development stage, the user would have unlimited buying power. Even though the user has unlimited buying power, purchasing zero, negative, and partial shares is still prohibited. After done purchase the first company, the program will show that you have purchased XXX company for XXX shares and prompt if you would like to make another stock purchase or select back to the main menu.

Secondly, suppose you choose “1”(import from file) when creating a portfolio, and hit enter. In that case, this is where the program wants to prompt a file to build a portfolio for the user, just like what we did for the “fill out the form” way; we are still going to check the validation of your XML file, if the company symbol is not exist or the share of your stock is not a positive integer value, the portfolio will still not be added into user portfolio file. The portfolio added from the XML will still be added to the user’s XML and get updated.

Both of the add methods will be navigated back to the main menu.
You can choose to view your portfolio by entering the “1” from the main. The program will print all the created portfolios from “Fill out the form” or “By import”; however, this is just the preview of your portfolio list; it only demonstrates which company the user had investigated the user had purchased. Here is where you can select which portfolio you want to inspect or go back to the main and give up the portfolio name input. After the selection, you can actually see how many shares the user investigated on each company. Then, you can input “3” to check the actual price of one particular day. The date has to be a regular business day; if it is not, it tells that the market is closed and no data will be available; the user will be prompted to enter again for the date. Upon successfully entering the date, all the shares under one company symbol will be calculated and shown based on the corresponding high and low values; not only will the one company symbol be calculated, but the total price high and low of the portfolio will be calculated and printed. After that, the user will be led back to the previous layer to choose a portfolio.
